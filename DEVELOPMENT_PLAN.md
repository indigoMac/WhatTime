## Critical Project Insight 🚨

### Three Separate Implementations Discovered

This project actually contains **THREE different implementations** of the WhatTime concept:

1. **`backend/`** - **Full Express.js API with Drizzle ORM**

   - Complete backend with database, auth, routes
   - Likely runs on port 8000 (mentioned in terminal output)
   - **Already has the infrastructure we need!**

2. **`whattime/`** - **Office Add-in (Current Focus)**

   - Simple Express server for serving Office Add-in files
   - Microsoft Graph SSO configured
   - Needs to CONNECT to the existing backend API

3. **`whattime_example/`** - **Next.js Frontend**
   - Complete React frontend with meeting creation UI
   - Has the meeting management features we want
   - Could serve as UI reference for Office Add-in

### Revised Strategy 🎯

Instead of building database from scratch, we should:

1. **Connect Office Add-in to existing backend API**
2. **Port UI components from Next.js example to Office Add-in**
3. **Leverage existing backend infrastructure**

This changes our development approach significantly!
