# WhatTime Office Add-in Development Plan

## Current Project Status ✅

### Infrastructure Complete

- **Office Add-in**: Successfully running on port 3000 with HTTPS
- **ngrok Tunnel**: Active at `https://3cc9-62-197-59-137.ngrok-free.app`
- **Manifest**: Updated and validated (`whattime/manifest.xml`)
- **SSO Foundation**: Microsoft Graph SSO configured (needs testing)
- **Backend Placeholder**: Express server on port 3000 (needs database connection)
- **Separate Backend**: Full Express.js backend exists in `backend/` directory

### Current Architecture

```
Office Add-in (Outlook) → ngrok → localhost:3000 → Express.js → [PostgreSQL needed]
                                     ↓
Separate Backend API (backend/) → localhost:8000 → PostgreSQL (existing)
```

## Critical Project Insight 🚨

### Three Separate Implementations Discovered

This project actually contains **THREE different implementations** of the WhatTime concept:

1. **`backend/`** - **Full Express.js API with Drizzle ORM**

   - Complete backend with database, auth, routes
   - Likely runs on port 8000 (mentioned in terminal output)
   - **Already has the infrastructure we need!**

2. **`whattime/`** - **Office Add-in (Current Focus)**

   - Simple Express server for serving Office Add-in files
   - Microsoft Graph SSO configured
   - Needs to CONNECT to the existing backend API

3. **`whattime_example/`** - **Next.js Frontend**
   - Complete React frontend with meeting creation UI
   - Has the meeting management features we want
   - Could serve as UI reference for Office Add-in

### Revised Strategy 🎯

Instead of building database from scratch, we should:

1. **Connect Office Add-in to existing backend API**
2. **Port UI components from Next.js example to Office Add-in**
3. **Leverage existing backend infrastructure**

This changes our development approach significantly!

## Development Phases

    - Authentication routes (`/api/auth/microsoft`, `/api/auth/me`)
    - Health check endpoint (`/health`)
    - Database connection with schema for users and calendar connections
    - Microsoft Graph integration for OAuth

- [x] **Start existing backend server** and test endpoints

  - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Backend running successfully:
    - Server running on port 8000
    - Database connection successful (console shows "✅ Database connection successful")
    - Health endpoint responding at `http://localhost:8000/health`
    - Environment: development mode confirmed

- [x] **Connect Office Add-in to backend API** instead of creating new database

  - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Office Add-in now connects to backend:
    - Office Add-in server tests backend connection on startup
    - Console shows "✅ Backend API connection successful: WhatTime API is running"
    - Connection test in `testBackendConnection()` function working
    - No need for new database - using existing PostgreSQL setup

## Instructions for New Cursor Sessions

### Session Preparation Checklist

Before starting any development session, ensure:

1. **Servers Running**:

   ```bash
   cd whattime
   npm start  # Starts Office Add-in on port 3000
   ```

2. **ngrok Active**:

   ```bash
   ngrok http https://localhost:3000
   # Update manifest.xml with new ngrok URL if changed
   ```

3. **Backend Status Check**:
   ```bash
   curl -k https://localhost:3000/taskpane.html  # Should return HTML
   curl https://[ngrok-url]/taskpane.html        # Should return HTML
   ```

### Session Organization Strategy

#### For Phase 1.1 - Backend Connection Session

**Files to Focus On**:

- `backend/src/` directory (existing Express.js API)
- `backend/package.json` (dependencies and scripts)
- `whattime/src/middle-tier/app.ts` (Office Add-in server)
- `whattime_example/` (UI reference)

**Session Goals**:

- Examine and start existing backend API
- Connect Office Add-in to backend instead of creating new database
- Fix template engine error in Office Add-in
- Test backend API endpoints

**Prompt Template**:

```
I'm working on a WhatTime Office Add-in project. I just discovered there are THREE separate implementations in this project:

1. backend/ - Full Express.js API with Drizzle ORM (EXISTING)
2. whattime/ - Office Add-in running on port 3000 (WORKING)
3. whattime_example/ - Next.js frontend (REFERENCE)

The Office Add-in is working with ngrok, but I need to connect it to the EXISTING backend API instead of building a new database. Please read the DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md file first for full context.

I need you to:
1. Examine the existing backend API in backend/src/ directory
2. Start the backend server and test its endpoints
3. Connect the Office Add-in to the existing backend API
4. Fix the "Error: Cannot find module 'html'" in the Office Add-in server
5. Map out the backend API structure for meeting management

Current status: Office Add-in works with ngrok, existing backend needs to be connected.
```

#### For Phase 1.2 - Authentication Integration Session

**Files to Focus On**:

- `whattime/src/middle-tier/msgraph-helper.ts`
- `whattime/src/middle-tier/ssoauth-helper.ts`
- `backend/src/auth/` (existing auth logic)
- `backend/src/routes/` (API endpoints)

**Session Goals**:

- Test Microsoft Graph SSO functionality
- Connect SSO to existing backend authentication
- Verify user flow between add-in and backend
- Test API communication

**Prompt Template**:

```
I'm working on a WhatTime Office Add-in with an existing backend API. The add-in loads successfully in Outlook and shows a welcome screen with "Get My User Profile Information" button. There's a separate backend API in backend/ directory with authentication already built.

I need you to:
1. Test the SSO functionality in the Office Add-in
2. Examine the existing backend authentication in backend/src/auth/
3. Connect the Office Add-in SSO tokens to the backend API
4. Test the complete authentication flow: Add-in → SSO → Backend API
5. Fix any authentication integration issues

Current status: Office Add-in loads, backend API exists, need to connect SSO to backend.
```

#### For Phase 2.1 - UI Migration Session

**Files to Focus On**:

- `whattime/src/taskpane/taskpane.html`
- `whattime/src/taskpane/taskpane.ts`
- `whattime_example/app/create/` (reference UI)
- `whattime_example/components/` (React components to port)

**Session Goals**:

- Examine Next.js frontend for UI patterns
- Replace welcome screen with meeting creation form
- Port React components to vanilla HTML/JS
- Connect form to backend API

**Prompt Template**:

```
I'm working on a WhatTime Office Add-in meeting scheduler. The SSO and backend API connection are working. I need to replace the current welcome screen with a meeting creation form by porting UI from the existing Next.js frontend.

I need you to:
1. Examine the Next.js frontend in whattime_example/ for meeting creation UI
2. Port the meeting creation components from React to vanilla HTML/JS/CSS
3. Replace the welcome screen in the Office Add-in with the new form
4. Connect the form to the existing backend API endpoints
5. Implement form validation and error handling

Current status: Authentication working, backend connected, need new UI based on existing frontend.
```

### General Development Guidelines

#### Before Each Session

1. **Read this file completely**
2. **Check current project status**
3. **Verify servers are running**
4. **Identify specific phase and goals**

#### During Development

1. **Focus on single phase only**
2. **Test frequently with curl/browser**
3. **Update this document with progress**
4. **Commit working code frequently**

#### Session Success Criteria

- **Phase 1.1**: Database tables created, Express connects to PostgreSQL, basic API endpoints work
- **Phase 1.2**: SSO button works, user authentication flow complete, user data in database
- **Phase 2.1**: Meeting creation form replaces welcome screen, form validation works
